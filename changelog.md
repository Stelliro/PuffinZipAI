## üõ†Ô∏è Development Cycles & Iterations

**Dev Cycle 0.9.x (Current Focus: GPU Foundations, Advanced ELS Dynamics, UI Stability)**

*   **Build 0.9.4 (Critical Startup & Import Fixes)**
    *   _Fixed:_ Resolved persistent `SyntaxError` in `gpu_ai_agent.py` fallback lambda definitions. This was a key blocker for `settings_gui.py` imports.
    *   _Fixed:_ Overhauled `puffinzip_ai/__init__.py`'s `config.py` auto-generation logic. Ensured correct ordering and `repr()` usage for all default variables (paths, literals, and os-dependent expressions), resolving cascading `ImportError`s and `NameError`s for config constants during application startup and module loading.
    *   _Improved:_ Enhanced robustness in `gpu_ai_agent.py` with more comprehensive placeholder classes and logger handling in `except ImportError` blocks to maintain stability if base AI components fail to import.
    *   _Improved:_ Minor stability improvements in `gpu_ai_agent.py` regarding attribute access (e.g., for `training_stats`, `learning_rate`).

*   **Build 0.9.3 (Config System Stability)**
    *   _Changed:_ Refined `puffinzip_ai/__init__.py` to use `ALL_CONFIG_DEFAULTS_INIT_TIME` as the definitive source for generating `config.py`, ensuring all required settings are present.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues (Snapshot - Subject to Change)
*   Actual GPU-accelerated RLE kernels (Python->CUDA C++ bridge) are not yet implemented; GPU mode currently relies on CuPy for array operations only where applicable.
*   Comprehensive unit and integration testing coverage is still in early stages.
*   User documentation and detailed in-app help/tooltips are pending.
*   Ongoing performance profiling and optimization for ELS (especially large populations/generations) and large file processing is required.
