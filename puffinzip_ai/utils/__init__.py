# PuffinZipAI_Project/puffinzip_ai/utils/__init__.py
# This file makes 'utils' a Python package.

# You can optionally import specific functions or classes from modules within utils
# to make them available directly from puffinzip_ai.utils
# For example:
# from .benchmark_generator import main_generate as generate_benchmarks

# For now, it can be empty if benchmark_generator.py is self-contained or run as a script.
